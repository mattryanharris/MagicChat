# MagicChat
Telegram Bot that impersonates notable figures

This is a Telegram chatbot that uses OpenAI's GPT model to generate sassy responses to user messages. The bot has the ability to switch between different personas and engage in football talk, making it a fun and interactive tool for users.

## Getting Started

To get started with this chatbot, you will need to create a Telegram bot and obtain a Telegram token. You will also need an OpenAI API key to use the GPT model. Once you have these, you can input them into the code and start the bot.

## Usage

The chatbot responds to messages sent in the Telegram group chat. If the bot is tagged, it will generate a response based on the message received. Users can also set a new persona for the bot by sending a message with the phrase "you are now" followed by the new persona.
